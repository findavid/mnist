# MNIST Digit Classification

This repository contains various machine learning and deep learning models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image representing a single digit from 0 to 9. The MNIST dataset is often used as the "Hello, World!" of machine learning programs for image classification.

Now it is my turn to say "Hello, World!".

# Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

## Data Exploration (01_data_exploration.ipynb): 
Initial exploration of the MNIST dataset, including the distribution of classes, visualization of digits, and class averages.

## Shallow Learning (02_shallow_learning.ipynb): 
Application of shallow learning techniques, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to the MNIST data. Model performances are evaluated and visualized.

## Deep Learning (03_deep_learning.ipynb): 
Implementation of deep learning models - Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification. The evaluation of models is visualized.
